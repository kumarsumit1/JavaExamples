 ### Introduction
 Big O notation, sometimes also called “asymptotic analysis”, primarily looks at how many operations a sorting algorithm takes to completely sort a very large collection of data. This is a measure of efficiency and is how you can directly compare one algorithm to another.
 
 
 
 While Quick Sort is the standard, it also competes with Merge Sort and Heap Sort, which are other O(n log n) rated sorting algorithms. There are scenarios where those are used instead.

The most direct competitor of Quick Sort is Heap Sort. Heap Sort’s running time is also O(n log n), but Heap Sort’s average running time is usually considered slower than in-place Quick Sort.

Merge Sort is a stable sort, which means it preserves the input order of equal elements in the output, unlike standard in-place Quick Sort and Heap Sort.

### Types of Big O Notaion

#### O(1)—Constant Time :
  An O(1) operation’s complexity is constant regardless of the number of inputs. 

Examples of 0(1) operations:

    Looking up element in a hash table.
    Adding a node to linked list.
    Accessing an element in an array by index.

#### O(log n) — Logarithmic Time:
When dealing with an O(log n) complexity operation, each cycle should reduce the complexity in relation to input. A prime example of this is a binary search. Each iteration halves the interval within which it searches.

Examples of 0(log n) operations:

    Binary search
	
#### O(n)—Linear Time

An O(n) operation’s complexity scales linearly with the number of inputs. If you iterate through all the elements in an array, it is O(n), because the operation is dependent on the number of items in your collection. 

Examples of 0(n) operations:

    Traversing an array or linked list.
    Removing a node from a specific index of a linked list.

#### O(nlog n) — superlinear Time:

Examples of 0(nlog n) operations:
	Heap Sort
	Merge Sort
	Quick Sort
	
#### O(n²)—Quadratic Time
An O(n²) operation’s complexity scales exponentially with the number of inputs. A simple example of an O(n²) is a process with a loop within a loop. 
Examples of 0(n²) operations:

    Traversing a 2D array
	Bubble Sort, 
	Selection Sort, 
	Insertion Sort,
	Bucket Sort.
